Here we go!
============

tl;dr: We are having open office hours from 4-5PM Eastern Time at [https://binghamton.zoom.us/j/945891712](https://binghamton.zoom.us/j/945891712).

A pandemic like the coronovirus is unprecedented in our lifetimes.
As researchers, educators, and students, we know that there is no replacement for the one-on-one discussion that advances understanding.
Luckily, the Internet has given us the opportunity to be socially distant without being academically isolated.

In other words, just because you need to stay away from other humans, doesn't mean that you need to stop learning.

We at iDRAMA Lab have spent the past 5 years as a distributed organization, regularly working with each other across 5 time zones, with rare in-person gatherings.
It's not easy, but, we've gotten decent at it.

To that end, iDRAMA Lab is opening up office hours to the world.

Come join us from 4-5PM Eastern Time and let's talk about research.

For this session, we will have the following for you to talk to:
